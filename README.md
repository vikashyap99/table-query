# Query table

# Ideation 

Features to Help Data Analysts:

Favorites or Bookmarks: Allowing users to save frequently used or important queries as favorites or bookmarks can streamline their workflow.
Query History: A feature to maintain a history of executed queries can help data analysts refer back to previous analyses and results.
Data Visualization: Integrating data visualization tools or charts can make it easier for data analysts to interpret and communicate their findings effectively.

# Design
This rough layout showcases the search input field, predefined query buttons, an execute button to trigger queries, the table with column headers and data, and pagination controls at the bottom for easy navigation. The focus is on making the application's essential features readily accessible to the user while maintaining a clear and logical flow.


# Optimization 

By using pagination, the application divides the dataset into manageable chunks, enhancing user experience and making it easier for data analysts to navigate through large datasets. This prevents overwhelming the user with too much data on a single page, leading to faster rendering times and a smoother user interface.

To further optimize the rendering performance, the useMemo hook is used to memoize the results of the renderContent and renderHeader functions. Memoization stores the result of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the inputs to the function have not changed. In this case, the visualData array serves as the input for the renderContent and renderHeader functions. By memoizing these functions with useMemo, unnecessary re-rendering of the table content and header is prevented when other parts of the component update.
